My name is Karl Fischer and I am a Software Engineer from Germany with a heavy focus on Back-End and Sysadmin topics.
I am currently working as a DevOps Engineer at [Project A Ventures](https://project-a.com) and in the past, besides Germany, have also studied/worked in Finland, Spain and China.

So far my main focus has been on Java and Python based stacks. Recently I started dealing with the Meteor stack too, but in general I enjoy working on deployment pipelines, automation and back-end development.

Besides programming, currently I try my best learning Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. Also, I love playing classical guitar, especially Flamenco style (I'm a huge John H. Clark Fan!).
