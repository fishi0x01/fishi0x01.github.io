My name is Karl and I am a Software Engineer from Germany.

My main focus is on platform architecture and automation of infrastructure, security and compliance. 
I am employed at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/) in Berlin.

Some technical principles/philosophies I fancy include [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), Immutability and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). However, above all stands pragmatism because I haven't seen the silver bullet yet.

In my free time I enjoy working on IoT projects, i.e., soldering prototypes, designing [PCBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) and programming [MCUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller). 
Further, I like [nix](https://nixos.org/), try coding in [go](https://github.com/fishi0x01/vsh) or [rust](https://github.com/fishi0x01/docker-extract) and am repeatedly overwhelmed and humbled by the unlimited knowledge of the open source community.

Apart from technical stuff, I practice [QwanKiDo](https://www.qwankidoberlin.de/), try to learn Mandarin Chinese and like to play classical guitar.
