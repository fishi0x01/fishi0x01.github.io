My name is Karl and I am a Software Engineer from Germany. 
{: .text-justify}

My main focus is on platform architecture and automation of infrastructure, security and compliance. 
I am employed at [D4L data4life gGmbH](https://www.data4life.care) in Berlin.

I try my best to every day practice something known or learn something new, even if it is just a small thing.
Some technical principles/philosophies I fancy include [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), Immutability and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). However, above all stands pragmatism because I haven't seen the silver bullet yet.

Like many people in my field I am a big fan of the [HashiCorp Stack](https://www.hashicorp.com/). 
Further, I like [nix](https://github.com/fishi0x01/local-env/tree/master/nix), enjoy programming in [go](https://github.com/fishi0x01/vsh) or [rust](https://github.com/fishi0x01/docker-extract) and am repeatedly overwhelmed and humbled by the unlimited knowledge of the open source community.

If I'm not in front of a computer or practicing [QwanKiDo](https://www.qwankido.ca/), I am likely to learn Mandarin Chinese or play classical guitar.
